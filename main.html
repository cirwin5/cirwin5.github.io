Group met in 141 Middleton Library at 6:30pm. Group discussed the outcomes of prior weeks research to improve on Java program. Group decided after much deliberation that the project was becoming too extensive. Found the program SoX and was able to conduct some of our goals within it. We decided that the best course of action was to develop a Java program that allowed users to select music files and then create a Bash script to run the program and implement some of SoX's features.
